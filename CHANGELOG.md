# Changelog

## v0.9.0

### Added

- **Single base sandbox image (`ghcr.io/vessux/openlock-base`).** Replaces the 4-cap image matrix (`openlock-core{,-js,-py,-js-py}`) with one content-hashed base. Each project commits a `.openlock/Containerfile` that declares the base via `FROM` and lists which harnesses to install. The host pulls the prebuilt base from ghcr when available, falls back to building locally on pull-fail (same flow for dev/offline/CI-pre-push). See `containers/base.Containerfile` for the source-of-truth; `openlock init` (lvc.1, future) will seed the per-project `.openlock/Containerfile` from the embedded base + harness selection.
- **`openlock update-base`** — rewrites `.openlock/Containerfile` `FROM` line to the current embedded base hash, preserving the harness block via sentinel matching. Use after a `bun upgrade openlock` if you want to pick up the latest base.
- **`openlock prune-images [--legacy] [--dry-run]`** — image GC. Default mode removes stale `openlock-sandbox:*` tags (not in use by any container) and non-current `ghcr.io/vessux/openlock-base:*` tags. With `--legacy`, also removes pre-v0.9 `openlock-core*` images.
- **`openlock --print-base-tag`** — prints the expected ghcr tag for the embedded `containers/base.Containerfile`. Used by CI to push the base image to the correct content-hash tag.
- **Live integration smoke for the slim-images pipeline.** Gated behind `OPENLOCK_LIVE_INTEGRATION=1`; verifies `ensureBase()` builds the base and `seedContainerfile()` + `ensureSandbox()` produces a working sandbox image with the harness binary resolved.

### Changed

- **Halved sandbox image size.** Final claude_code sandbox is ~640MB (vs ~1.4-1.57GB measured pre-v0.9). Driven by:
  - Slim node install via official tarball + `--exclude` doc trimming (~85MB vs ~244MB NodeSource deb).
  - Drop unused `bun`, `iptables`, `openssh-sftp-server`, `unzip` from the base.
  - Single base instead of 4 cap-variants (no longer duplicating layers across cap-permutation images).
- **Both `node` and `python3` + `uv` ship in every sandbox.** Caps detection is gone; any sandbox can run npm and uv without an `openlock init`-time question. Per-language tooling (e.g., bun) is added by the user editing `.openlock/Containerfile` if desired.
- **Per-arch `sha256` pinning for upstream node + uv tarballs** in `containers/base.Containerfile` (defense-in-depth beyond TLS trust).

### Removed

- **Breaking: `caps` field in `.openlock/config.yaml` is no longer used.** Accepted-and-ignored on read with a deprecation warning at `sandbox create`; will be removable via `openlock validate --fix` (lvc.2, future). Existing configs continue to work.
- **Breaking: pre-v0.9 sandbox images are orphaned.** Run `openlock prune-images --legacy` after upgrading to reclaim disk.
- `src/sandbox/detect-caps.ts`, `src/sandbox/default-containerfiles.ts`, `containers/core*.Containerfile`, `policies/default-{js,py,js-py}.yaml` — all gone.
- `caps: Cap[]` field stripped from in-flight `SessionMeta`. Pre-v0.9 session metadata files have `caps` silently ignored on load.

### Fixed

- `seedContainerfile()` no longer emits `ln -sf /usr/bin/<harness> /usr/local/bin/<harness>` — those lines were inherited from the NodeSource-deb base (npm prefix `/usr`). On the new tarball-slim base (prefix `/usr/local`), npm's own symlink at `/usr/local/bin/<harness>` is correct, and the `ln -sf` was clobbering it with a dangling target. Caught by the new live integration smoke.

## v0.8.0

### Added

- **Docker runtime support.** `OPENLOCK_RUNTIME=docker|podman` (or `default_runtime:` in `~/.config/openlock/config.yaml`) selects the container runtime; the first-run wizard prompts when autodetect is ambiguous. In-container controls (Landlock, seccomp, namespace/netns enforcement) are identical across runtimes — the differences are at the host trust boundary (rootful docker vs rootless podman), documented in the README threat model.

### Changed

- Bumped the openshell fork to **v0.6.0** (absorbs 36 upstream commits incl. per-sandbox auth, `SANDBOX_METHODS`, docker macOS host-gateway, L7 wildcards, Providers v2). openlock now provisions a per-sandbox gateway-minted JWT (signing bundle + `allow_unauthenticated_users`) in `ensure-gateway.ts`, required since the fork supervisor refuses to start without one.

### Removed

- **Anthropic auto-default removed (breaking).** openlock no longer silently selects the `anthropic` provider for the `claude_code` harness when credentials happen to exist. The provider must be explicit — `--provider`, `OPENLOCK_PROVIDER`, or `default_provider:` in `~/.config/openlock/config.yaml`. With no explicit selection, `sandbox` errors instead of guessing.
- Legacy `readToken()` / `writeToken()` shims removed from `src/tokens.ts`, superseded by the multi-provider `readProvider` / `writeProvider` / `hasAnyProvider` API.

### Fixed

- **Gateway lifecycle:** keep the gateway alive while any session metadata exists; non-destructive `stop` + reap with auto-start on reattach; retry `openshell sandbox create` once on early failure.

## v0.7.0

### Security

- **`openlock-hnp` — sandbox egress bypass fixed.** Pre-v0.7.0 openlock launched the harness via raw `podman exec`, landing it in the container's default netns with no `HTTPS_PROXY`, no Landlock, no `cred_inject`. Outbound HTTPS reached real upstreams directly — the sandbox wasn't actually a sandbox. Affected Mac and Linux equally; CI never caught it because the existing live tests use `openshell sandbox create -- /bin/bash -c "..."` (which goes through the supervisor and gets full enforcement), but the post-create attach path that real openlock invocations use was never exercised. Fix routes the harness via `openshell sandbox exec`, so the supervisor applies the proxy env, TLS bundle, netns enter, and Landlock seccomp. Defense-in-depth follow-up (`openlock-9nv`) tracks closing the host-side `podman exec` bypass too.

### Added

- **Provider abstraction (xoz).** `openlock login` is now a wizard that supports multiple providers. New `openrouter` provider works with the `opencode` harness. Same strip-and-replace credential protection as the existing Claude Code / Anthropic path — real key never enters the sandbox; gateway rewrites `Authorization` at HTTP egress.
- `--provider <id>` flag on `sandbox`, `login`, `logout`. Selection precedence: flag > `OPENLOCK_PROVIDER` env > `~/.config/openlock/config.yaml` `default_provider:` > error.
- `openlock providers` — list configured providers (stored / in-gateway / compatible harnesses).
- `openlock logout [--provider <id>]` — delete stored provider credentials (interactive picker when no flag).
- Global config `default_provider:` key.
- `bun run render:policies` script. Default policies (`policies/default*.yaml`) are now generated from the provider registry; CI drift test fails if committed files diverge.

### Changed

- `~/.config/openlock/credentials.json` is now multi-provider (v2 shape). Existing v1 files migrate silently on first read.
- `providers/refresh.yaml` accepts a new `source: file` kind for credentials stored in the multi-provider file. `openrouter` provider entry uses it.
- Default policies (`policies/default*.yaml`) now include an `opencode` block with both `api.anthropic.com` (x-api-key cred_inject) and `openrouter.ai` (Authorization Bearer cred_inject) endpoints. Per-binary cap-aware binaries (claude+node / claude+python3 / claude+node+python3) preserved.

### Deprecated

- For the `claude_code` harness with no provider signal AND a stored anthropic record, openlock auto-selects `anthropic` and prints a one-shot deprecation hint. The auto-default is removed in v0.8.0; users should set `--provider`, `OPENLOCK_PROVIDER`, or `default_provider:` to silence.
- Legacy `readToken()` / `writeToken()` shims in `src/tokens.ts` are removed in v0.8.0.

## v0.6.0

### Breaking

- **Mount system v2.** `.openlock/config.yaml` `mounts[]` now supports four types: `copy-once`, `copy-refresh`, `bind` (live `podman -v` passthrough), `git-bundle` (host repo bundled in + cloned in container). The workdir mount at `/sandbox/repo` is now **optional**; absence yields an empty `/sandbox/repo`. Existing configs that depend on the prior bundle-of-`projectPath` behaviour must add an explicit `git-bundle` workdir mount:
  ```yaml
  mounts:
    - source: .
      target: /sandbox/repo
      type: git-bundle
  ```
  See README "Seeds: mounts, args, env" for the full type matrix + examples.
- Fork pin bumped to [`vessux/OpenShell` v0.4.0-rc.1](https://github.com/vessux/OpenShell/releases/tag/v0.4.0-rc.1) for `--volume` + auto userns-remap on rootless podman.

### Added

- `--branch <name>` flag on `openlock sandbox`. Honoured for `git-bundle` workdir (clones with `-b <branch>`); rejected (exit 2) for `bind`/absent workdir with explanatory stderr.
- README: 6 worked examples covering workdir + non-workdir cases; security/ownership/VM-driver notes for bind.

### Fixed

- Image-level provisioning of `/sandbox/repo` so openshell's PID 1 chdir succeeds even when no workdir mount is declared (PR #30).
- `createSession` waits for openshell's async `--upload` to land in `/sandbox/.openlock/` before tearing down the staging tmp dir (race surfaced when container start got faster with the image-level mkdir).
- Bundle clone idempotency check uses `[ -d ${target}/.git ]` instead of `[ -d ${target} ]` so the image-baked empty `/sandbox/repo` doesn't suppress the first clone.

### Known limitations

- `cleanSession --copy-dir` hardcodes `/sandbox/repo` + `/sandbox/out.bundle` paths; under bind workdir it produces redundant bundle work, under no-workdir-mount it produces an empty copy. Deferred to post-v0.6.0 cleanup.
- Mac smoke matrix (Plan B Task 17 Steps 1-6) verified against PR #30 HEAD on 2026-05-21. Lima ARM64 (Steps 7-8) deferred to user.

### Mac smoke matrix results — 2026-05-21

| Step | Scenario | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | git-bundle workdir → clone, commit inside, sync-back to `refs/heads/openlock/<session>` | ✅ |
| 2 | bind workdir → bidirectional edits, "Bind workdir; no sync-back needed." | ✅ |
| 3 | bind read-only sub-mount (target `/home/sandbox/logs`) → read OK, write blocked | ✅ |
| 4 | no workdir mount → empty `/sandbox/repo` provisioned by image, "No workdir mount; skipping sync-back." | ✅ |
| 5 | `--branch` rejection on bind + absent workdir → exit 2 with spec messages | ✅ |
| 6 | invalid configs (copy-* at `/sandbox/repo`, git-bundle basename collision) → parse errors | ✅ |
| 7a | Lima ARM64 --branch validators (5+6) | ✅ |
| 7b | Lima ARM64 container create (1/2/3/4) | ✅ (after Linux fixes below) |
| 8 | VM-driver bind rejection | pending (separate openshell config) |

Fixes discovered during smoke that landed in PR #30:
- Image-level `/sandbox/repo` provisioning.
- Staging-upload race wait.
- Bundle clone idempotency check (`.git` instead of dir).
- Fork pin bump v0.3.0 → v0.4.0-rc.1.
- README: bind log example moved to `/home/sandbox/logs` (avoid `/sandbox/.openlock/` upload collision).
- **Gateway `--bind-address 0.0.0.0` on Linux** — on rootless podman, containers see `host.containers.internal` as the slirp4netns/pasta gateway IP (not loopback), so the gateway must bind a non-loopback interface. Mac unaffected (podman-machine VM bridges back to host 127.0.0.1).
- **Sandbox uid 999999 in `openlock-core` images, with numeric `USER 999999:999999` directive** — picks a uid that fits both macOS podman-machine's default subuid range (100000-1099999) and Linux's typical 524288+ range. The openshell fork parses `Config.User` as numeric and applies `--userns=keep-id:uid=N,gid=N` when any bind mount is present, so the in-image sandbox uid must match for host-owned bind sources to be writable from inside the container on Linux. Without this, container→host writes failed with EACCES on rootless podman.
- **CI: live integration job** — `.github/workflows/test.yml` now runs `tests/integration/` under `OPENLOCK_LIVE_INTEGRATION=1` in a separate job after the unit-test pass. Keeps local `bun test` fast (3 integration tests still skip without the env var) while ensuring the gated tests never silently regress.
